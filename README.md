# pandas-challenge

In this repository, you will find PyCitySchools_starter, which is a Jupyter Lab notebook that acts as a rubric/outline for the homework assignment. 
The resources folder contains the two datasets that are used for this homework assignment. The folder PyCitySchools contains the main.ipynb file, 
which is the Jupyter Lab file that contains all my code and dataframe outputs. 

I consulted AskBCS twice for this assignment and TA Paveen once. The first AskBCS support session helped me figure out that I was unable to create 
a dataframe because one of the dictionary entries was not a series but another dataframe. The second AskBCS support helped me troubleshoot my code 
when I was stuck on the per_school_summary. TA Paveen helped me fix a formatting error that was precluding me from doing math on the values. All 
of the code is my own.

Thank you, grader!
